  The NextJS version of Dot Browser (browser.dothq.co) will be kept online until the Gatsby version is deployed. Gatsby is quite new to us, and expect some bugs. Some links which previously worked in the NextJS version may not work in the Gatsby version. If you discover any broken links, please <a href="/issues/new">report them to us here</a>.

  Dot Browser <i>(browser.dothq.co)</i>
</h1>

Welcome to the frontend side of the Dot Browser website! Our pages are in `pages/`, the assets are at `src/images`, and fonts are at `src/fonts`.

_Have an idea for our website? You can drop a suggestion in our [Discord server](https://invite.gg/dot) or [create an issue in this repo](/issues/new)._

## ðŸš€ Running locally

1.  **Clone the repo**

    If you have [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed, this should be an easy task.

    ```shell
    # cloning our repo...
    git clone https://github.com/dothq/browser.dothq.co
    ```

1.  **Install dependencies**

    We recommend using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of [npm](https://npm.im), as npm causes issues with Gatsby.

    ```shell
    cd browser.dothq.co
    yarn
    ```

1.  **Run the development server**

    Once all the dependencies have installed without errors, run the following commands in your terminal.

    ```shell
    yarn develop
    ```

1.  **Start hacking**

    You should see a message in the terminal like this:

    ```shell
    You can now view gatsby-starter-default in the browser.
    â €
      http://localhost:8000/
    â €
    View GraphiQL, an in-browser IDE, to explore your site's data and schema
    â €
      http://localhost:8000/___graphql
    â €
    Note that the development build is not optimized.
    To create a production build, use gatsby build
    ```

    The site is now running and you can visit in your browser of choice *(hopefully [Dot Browser](https://github.com/dothq/browser))* at `localhost:8000/`. If the port is different in the above message, you can substitute `:8000` for what it says above.

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
